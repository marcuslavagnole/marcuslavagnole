## Marcus L. Nascimento

I am a Junior Research Scientist at the¬†[Jos√© Luiz Egydio Set√∫bal Foundation](https://fundacaojles.org.br/en/) (FJLES).

I hold a BSc in Actuarial Science and an MSc in Statistics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Currently, I am a DSc candidate in Statistics at the same institution. My research interests lie in applying and developing statistical methods for survey data analysis and social and health problems.

From 2021 to 2024, I was an Advisor at the¬†[Rio de Janeiro City Hall](https://prefeitura.rio/) (PCRJ). In partnership with colleagues from PCRJ, I have designed the¬†[Observat√≥rio Econ√¥mico do Rio](https://observatorioeconomico.rio/), an initiative to publicize economic indicators and policies. For example, we have developed the¬†[Indicator of Economic Activity](https://github.com/marcuslavagnole/IAE_Rio) (IAE-Rio) as a part of the project.

Here is my [CV](https://github.com/marcuslavagnole/marcuslavagnole/blob/main/CV.pdf) and [publications](https://github.com/marcuslavagnole/Publications). For more information, contact me at [marcus.gerardus@fundacaojles.org.br](mailto:marcus.gerardus@fundacaojles.org.br).
