## Marcus L. Nascimento

I am a Research Scientist at the [José Luiz Egydio Setúbal Foundation](https://fundacaojles.org.br/en/) (FJLES). My research interests lie in applying and developing statistical methods for survey data analysis and real-world problems.

<!--
I hold a BSc in Actuarial Science and an MSc in Statistics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Currently, I am a DSc candidate in Statistics at the same institution. My research interests lie in applying and developing statistical methods for survey data analysis and real-world problems.

From 2021 to 2024, I was an Advisor at the [Rio de Janeiro City Hall](https://prefeitura.rio/) (PCRJ). In partnership with colleagues from PCRJ, I developed the [Indicator of Economic Activity](https://github.com/marcuslavagnole/IAE_Rio) (IAE-Rio) and designed the [Observatório Econômico do Rio](https://observatorioeconomico.rio/), an initiative to publicize economic indicators and policies. From 2018 to 2019, I was a Data Scientist at Accenture, mainly working on projects for companies in the telecommunications industry.

Here is my [CV](https://github.com/marcuslavagnole/marcuslavagnole/blob/main/CV.pdf) and [publications](https://github.com/marcuslavagnole/Publications). For more information, contact me at [marcus.gerardus@fundacaojles.org.br](mailto:marcus.gerardus@fundacaojles.org.br).
